# PandocGUI
This project provides a GUI for Pandoc by using JavaFX. It's a kind of prototype for me to learn JavaFX.

# Author
Sebastian Hesse

# Technologies
Java, JavaFX, CSS, Maven

# Usage
1. You can download the source code, compile the files and run the `Main` class. 
2. An application opens with multiple text fields and some buttons. You need to specify the location of your Pandoc executable, the output file you want to create and at least one file you want to convert. 
3. Optional: add command options.
4. Then click "Generate" and the corresponding Pandoc command is generated.
5. Check generated command and click "Execute!" to execute the command.
6. Be happy :)
